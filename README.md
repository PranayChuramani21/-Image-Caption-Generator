# Image Caption Generator
This project is based on an intuitive CNN model that assigns a caption to the given image

### Description
Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description of an image. It uses the principles of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to generate relevant captions for the given images.

Human brain is capable of annotating or labeling an image whenever it comes in front of us. This model processes an image and label it with a highly relevant and accurate caption. With the enhancement of Computer Vision and Deep learning algorithms, availability of relevant datasets, and AI models, this model acts as a relevant caption generator for an image.

Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision.
